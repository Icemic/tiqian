// GlobalServices: the page-wide Service container (wc-s5 ruling R9,
// 2026-08-26). A service is behavior plus the private state that behavior
// owns; the container holds exactly the services whose scope is the whole
// document. Today that is one member: the coordination service, which owns
// the page frame clock, admission ordering, worker grants and the
// font/measurement coordination state those grants read.
//
// Container admission criteria: a member must be page-level behavior reached
// from async host callbacks (ResizeObserver, IntersectionObserver,
// requestAnimationFrame entry points) that never see a construction context.
// Behavior-less state records do not belong here: state that only needs
// cross-copy sharing lives in its owning module's closure behind a
// Symbol.for registry key (the prepared-styles, snapshot-table,
// snapshot-adoption, viewport-anchor and stylesheet-loader records moved to
// that pattern in this ruling).
//
// The container must be one per document rather than one per module copy
// because client routers, dev HMR and duplicated package chunks can evaluate
// this module more than once in the same document. The Symbol.for key shares
// one container across those copies. Members are resolved through the
// globalServices() accessor rather than passed as parameters because hosts
// reach the services from async callbacks without a construction context.
//
// Explicit initialization (wc-s6 scope 8): the container is not auto-
// constructed on first access. Hosts must call initializeGlobalServices()
// before any service access; registerTiqianProse does this. Access before
// initialization throws an error pointing to the initialization function.
//
// Library-internal, test-only injection: installGlobalServicesForTesting
// swaps the container for an explicit replacement and returns a restore
// function. Hosts must not touch it.
